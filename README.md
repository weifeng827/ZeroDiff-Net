# ZeroDiff-Net
The code and the polarization dataset for the paper titled "ZeroDiff-Net: Polarization-Guided Zero-Shot Diffusion Network for Underwater Image Recovery"
In our previous, we havae collected various underwater polarization images covering various water bodies. We have upload our dataset at  Baidu Netdisk. 
Among them, the first link is a complete water tank scene dataset, the second link is a natural water body dataset, and the remaining links are partial datasets. Once the paper is accepted, all the remaining datasets and code will be uploaded. The remaining ones include datasets used for underwater binocular stereo matching and photogrammetry.
